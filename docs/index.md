# Interactive Distance-Controlled Visual Output — Lab Manual

**Goal:** Build a fun, quick prototype where the Raspberry Pi's screen changes depending on how close the user is to the ultrasonic sensor attached to an ESP32.

**Why this is good for students:** simple hardware, clear visual feedback, teaches sensors, wireless comms (MQTT), and basic multimedia control.

## Quick demo (1 min)
1. Power both boards.
2. Upload code to ESP32 (fill in WiFi credentials).
3. Start MQTT broker on Pi and run the display script.
4. Move your hand towards/away from the HC-SR04 — watch the screen change.
